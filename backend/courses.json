I)\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThermal engineering encompasses a broad range of topics that include the behavior of matter and energy and their interaction as part of a system with the surrounding environment. This course covers topics from the fields of thermodynamics and heat transfer. You will learn how to identify systems and to use thermodynamic analysis to describe the behavior of the system in terms of properties and processes. Heat transfer between systems is a fundamental part of many engineering disciplines. While thermodynamics provides the foundation for understanding the energy distribution in a system in equilibrium, heat transfer provides a means for determining the rates of energy transfer under a variety of conditions. Understanding how to apply these concepts is a powerful tool for the engineer, enabling the evaluation of material states (phases) under different conditions and the maximum efficiency achievable with various power cycles. After completing this course, you should be able to define and describe properties and processes used in thermodynamic analysis and the governing laws. You should also be able to define and describe the phenomena of conduction, convection, and radiation and apply the heat diffusion equation to determine the temperature distribution in objects subject to different thermal boundary conditions. Finally, you should be able to calculate the heat transfer rates for objects subject to different (and combined) modes of heat transfer.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommended background: basic physics, (PH 1110, PH 1111) elementary differential and integral calculus (MA 1021, MA 1022), ordinary differential equations (MA2051) or equivalent.\u003C/p\u003E",

I; 1/3 unit) This course will provide a foundational experience by exposing students to how research questions are identified and addressed via biological experimentation. Importantly, the lab will also serve as a unifying experience for biology majors, providing a framework that will allow them to identify as contributing members of a scientific community. This lab will convey the breadth of biological systems from organismal to molecular scales, and the overarching principles of evolution and effects of environment on behavior. Focus areas may include how resistance to antibiotics arises, how ecosystems and organisms are adversely affected by pollution, and how experiments can be designed to identify strategies to overcome global problems. This introductory biology lab experience is intended for first-year Biology &amp; Biotechnology majors, and anyone intending to take 3800 level biology laboratories. Recommended background: High school biology. No previous laboratory experience is assumed.\u003C/p\u003E",

In the first half of the 20th century, this trend accelerated with the rise of redlining, zoning, financial racism, and urban renewal to enforce racial segregation in American cities. At the close of the 20th century, the forces of privatization, deregulation and globalization compounded already dire urban environmental inequities. This course allows student to appreciate how historical urban land use shapes urban ecological patterns and how biological laboratory practices connect to and inform on-going struggles for environmental justice in a postindustrial city. To achieve this integration – the ground underfoot – the soil and its microorganisms as well as the history of its use – will provide the foundation upon which to build connection between biological and historical methodologies. While many recent discussions in urban ecology and design have revolved around “green infrastructure” and its role in climate resiliency, food justice, heat island mitigation, toxic sequestration, and stormwater management, this course will explore the soils that serves as the foundation for all “green infrastructure” by supporting broader ecosystem service in the city.

There are numerous potential variables that influence the amount, quality, and cost of producing these molecules. This course will explore some of those variables which allow students to design, test, and evaluate strategies for product and process optimizations. Students will learn how DNA sequences are designed, constructed, and analyzed. A model organism will be grown and induced to express a protein product using common fermentation principles and techniques. Students will evaluate efficiency of the fermentation and output of the gene product through an original research project of their design.

The generation of a potent antibody therapeutics is an iterative design process that involves the generation and optimization of antibodies to improve their clinical potential. Dozens of monoclonal antibodies are in clinical use to treat graft rejection, Crohn’s disease, asthma, leukemia, other cancers, and immune disorders. They continue to generate a market value approaching $200 billion and growing nearly 15% each year. Molecular biology makes it possible to reproducibly clone recombinant versions of antibodies, including chimeric, humanized, and human antibodies with optimized effectiveness. In this course, we explore the use of antibodies as therapeutic agents based on early-stage discovery, generation, and selection of antibodies from immune and non-immune sources. Topics include the origin and structure of antibodies, their molecular and pharmacological properties, and key methods used in the biotechnology industry to develop and produce them. In addition, will uncover the fast-growing antibodies as antibody-drug conjugates for cancer therapeutics. Weekly online assessments are designed to ensure understanding.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EPrerequisite Courses:\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EAn undergraduate level background in Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, basics of immunology or equivalent experience is recommended.\u003C/p\u003E",

Extensive research efforts have been expended on understanding how biologic systems interact with biomaterials. Meanwhile, controversy has revolved around biomaterials and their availability as a result of the backlash to the huge liability resulting from controversies related to material and processing shortcomings of medical devices. This course specifically addresses the unique role of biomaterials in medical device design and the use of emerging biomaterials technology in medical devices. The need to understand design requirements of medical devices based on safety and efficacy will be addressed. Unexpected device failure can occur if testing fails to account for synergistic interactions from chronic loading, aqueous environments, and biologic interactions. Testing methodologies are readily available to assess accelerated effects of loading in physiologic-like environments. This combined with subchronic effects of animal implants is a potential tool in assessing durability. It is difficult to predict the chronic effects of the total biologic environment. The ultimate determination of safety comes not only from following the details of regulations, but with an understanding of potential failure modes and designs that lowers the risk of these failures. This course will evaluate biomaterials and their properties as related to the design and reliability of medical devices.\u003C/p\u003E",

Concepts covered combine Computer Aided Drawing (CAD) and Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques. Application software such as AutoCAD Civil 3D, Autodesk Revit and Navisworks are used in this course. Students are required to become familiar with the software packages; specific skills taught are basic 2D drawing techniques, advanced 3D drawing and rendering techniques, basic 3D software environments, object creation and manipulation, assemblies of objects, surface and terrain modeling, building modeling, geographic and building information databases. Emphasis is given to the adaptability of this method to changes in design and to the generation of graphic design documentation. Lastly, software packages change over time, and different packages are used by different organizations. This course has an overall goal of training students in the thinking behind software, so as not to be tied to particular software but instead to be adaptable to changing circumstances. Knowledge of the subject matter in at least two Civil Engineering design courses is expected background for this course.\u003C/p\u003E",

This course introduces students to the practice of negotiation and mediation in the context of design and construction. Learning from general theories of negotiation and conflict resolution, students will consider the role of Construction Managers as mediators and consensus-builders who must reconcile conflicting visions about how a specific project should be designed and developed. The course examines a variety of contexts and problems that create a need for negotiation, and raise questions about what it means to negotiate well. It examines how negotiators manage their interactions and ask, &#34;Why do we get one deal rather than another?&#34; The course reviews how negotiators create opportunities for mutual gains, how they construct relationships in which trust is possible, and to how they build sympathy in their interactions. The course also examines the ways in which expanding issues, adding parties, negotiating at multiple levels, and acting in a community context influence negotiation practice. It concludes by understanding how a third neutral party (mediator) could help in managing and solving conflicts.\u003C/p\u003E",

The course will involve large-scale programming exercises and will be designed to help students confront issues of safe programming with system-level constructs. The course will cover several tools that assist programmers in these tasks. Students will be expected to design, implement, and debug programs in C&#43;&#43; and C. The course presents the material from CS 2301 at a fast pace and also includes C&#43;&#43; and other advanced topics.Recommended background: CS 2102, CS 2103, or CS 2119 and/or substantial object-oriented programming experience.\u003C/p\u003E",

Generative Artificial Intelligence (3 credits) Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) is a class of machine learning models that generate new data (text, images, faces, voice, artwork) that is near indistinguishable from the equivalent real data typically generated by humans. These models are trained based on realistic example data sets from the real world. This course covers the underlying fundamentals of generative models. It also introduces the design and modeling of some of the modern generative models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion models, ChatGPT, Large Language Models, to name a few. Several applications will be discussed, ranging from image generation for engineering or science applications to the utilization of generated data for data augmentation in AI systems. Ethical concerns related to the danger of these generative technologies concerning issues from misinformation, bias, to data ownership are reviewed. Recommended Background: Core artificial intelligence classes, such as machine learning and deep learning, or equivalent background is highly recommended.\u003C/p\u003E",

Generative Artificial Intelligence (3 credits) Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) is a class of machine learning models that generate new data (text, images, faces, voice, artwork) that is near indistinguishable from the equivalent real data typically generated by humans. These models are trained based on realistic example data sets from the real world. This course covers the underlying fundamentals of generative models. It also introduces the design and modeling of some of the modern generative models: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion models, ChatGPT, Large Language Models, to name a few. Several applications will be discussed, ranging from image generation for engineering or science applications to the utilization of generated data for data augmentation in AI systems. Ethical concerns related to the danger of these generative technologies concerning issues from misinformation, bias, to data ownership are reviewed. Recommended Background: Core artificial intelligence classes, such as machine learning and deep learning, or equivalent background is highly recommended.\u003C/p\u003E",

In this course, we discuss social responsibility around data privacy, bias in data and decision making, policies as guardrails, fairness and transparency in the context of applying AI algorithms. Case studies considering societal challenges caused by AI technologies may include AI-based hiring recommendations stemming from societal biases present in training datasets, AI-empowered selfdriving cars behaving in a dangerous manner when encountering atypical road conditions, digital health applications inadvertently revealing private patient information, or large language models like chat-GPT generating incorrect or harmful responses. This course also studies AI-based algorithmic solutions to some of these challenges. These include the design of robust machine learning algorithms with constraints to ensure fairness, privacy, and safety. Strategies for how to apply these methods to design safe and fair AI are introduced. Topics may include min-max optimization with applications to training machine learning models robust to adversarial attacks, stochastic methods for preserving privacy of sensitive data, and multi-agent machine learning models for reducing algorithmic bias and polarization in recommender systems.

Students will learn the assessment of the needs and concerns of stakeholders, the knowledge of analytical tools, including randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), and the ability to formulate evidence-based recommendations. We begin by examining the advantages and disadvantages of using observational studies to identify the determinants of outcomes in which policy makers are often interested. We then consider quasi-experiments and learn about their advantages and disadvantages. Finally, we focus on how to use RCTs in the field to obtain accurate measures of policy effectiveness. We will cover a significant amount of literature on education, health, agricultural, and finance-related interventions. You will also complete a research project that will give you the opportunity to develop the skills necessary to successfully design, conduct, and analyze the results of RCTs aimed at answering important policy questions. Recommended background: Basic knowledge of the common methods (qualitative and quantitative) that are typically used for evaluating development-related policy and interventions.

I, 3 credits) This course surveys the application of data science (DS) and machine learning (ML) to problems arising in engineering and the sciences. While DS and ML have profoundly affected domains such as image understanding and natural language processing, ML has seen comparatively less impact in chemistry, physics, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, and many other important application domains. Topics covered will include predictive modeling, feature engineering, and model assessment, with a particular focus on the small-data limit. We will analyze and apply algorithms with wide applicability in engineering and sciences including classic techniques such as multiple linear regression and random forests, and state-of-the-art techniques such as deep neural networks. Recommended Background: The intention is for the class to be accessible to a wide audience in disciplines outside of Computer Science and Data Science, though some basic background topics such as statistics or linear algebra, and the ability to learn Python programming at a basic level would be helpful.\u003C/p\u003E",

In this course, we discuss social responsibility around data privacy, bias in data and decision making, policies as guardrails, fairness and transparency in the context of applying AI algorithms. Case studies considering societal challenges caused by AI technologies may include AI-based hiring recommendations stemming from societal biases present in training datasets, AI-empowered selfdriving cars behaving in a dangerous manner when encountering atypical road conditions, digital health applications inadvertently revealing private patient information, or large language models like chat-GPT generating incorrect or harmful responses. This course also studies AI-based algorithmic solutions to some of these challenges. These include the design of robust machine learning algorithms with constraints to ensure fairness, privacy, and safety. Strategies for how to apply these methods to design safe and fair AI are introduced. Topics may include min-max optimization with applications to training machine learning models robust to adversarial attacks, stochastic methods for preserving privacy of sensitive data, and multi-agent machine learning models for reducing algorithmic bias and polarization in recommender systems.

This course explores these foundations by using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment. Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential circuits, and synchronous state machines. Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test, and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs.\u003Cbr /\u003ERecommended background: Introductory Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts covered in a course such as ECE 2010 or RBE 1001, and MA 1022.

This course explores these foundations by using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment. Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential circuits, and synchronous state machines. Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test, and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs.\u003Cbr /\u003ERecommended background: Introductory Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts covered in a course such as ECE 2010 or RBE 1001, and MA 1022.

On any given day we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run cell phones, take pictures, play music, control elevators, manage the emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security system, and so on. Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory, emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD displays, SPI ports, pulse width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about embedded system theory and design. Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C, microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies, use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and resource management, applications case studies. Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained programming.

I\u003Cbr /\u003EThe object of this course is a comprehensive treatment of electromagnetic engineering principles covering the entire application spectrum from static to dynamic field phenomena. The starting point will be the basic electric and magnetic field definitions of Coulomb and Biot-Savart leading to Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws. They form the foundation of electro- and magnetostatics fields. Students will examine capacitive and inductive systems and relate them to lumped element circuit models. By introducing temporal and spatial magnetic flux variations, Faraday’s law is established. The engineering implications of this law are investigated in terms of transformer and motor actions. Incorporation of the displacement current density into Ampere’s law and combining it with Faraday’s law will then culminate in the complete set of Maxwell’s field equations. As a result of these equations, students will develop the concept of wave propagation in the time and frequency domain with practical applications such as wireless communication, radar, Global Positioning Systems, and microwave circuits.\u003Cbr /\u003ERecommended background: ECE 2019.\u003C/p\u003E",

        "Course_Description": "\u003Cp\u003EThe availability of electric power in a variety of forms is integral to modern society. Very often, electric power must be converted from one form to another to meet a specific application need – this conversion process is accomplished through the use and efficient management of power electronics. Design of power electronics is introduced first by examining the performance characteristics of basic switching devices, which enable critical management functions that include pulse width modulation (PWM) and output power regulation. Half and full-wave AC source rectification and techniques for improving the resulting DC power characteristics are covered, including polyphase AC sources. AC voltage control with applications for induction motors is studied. DC-DC power conversion is examined, covering a variety of circuit architectures, with applications in feedback control. DC to AC power inversion and resulting power quality considerations are explored. The impacts of design decisions on power electronics systems, from micro- to megawatts, are demonstrated through numerical simulation. This course includes guest lectures, project work including case-studies and selected power system demonstrations.

Some engineers, when faced with design problems, immediately fill up pages and pages of calculations, or do complex circuit simulations or finite-element analyses. One problem with this approach is that if you get an answer, you do not know if it is correct unless you have an intuitive “feel” for what the answer should be. The application of some simple rules of thumb and design techniques is a possible first step to developing intuition into the behavior of complex electrical systems. This course outlines some ways of thinking about analog circuits and systems that are intended will help to develop intuition and guide design.

Mathematics at a level comparable to that taught in MA 1021-MA 1024 is frequently applied to lend precision to the analysis. The course rigorously develops the microeconomic foundations of the theory of the firm, the theory of the consumer, the theory of markets, and the conditions required for efficiency in economic systems.\nRecommended background: ECON 1110.

Material introduced beyond English will rely on translations but may also include attention to work in the original language. Attention to drama, poetry, and prose from various periods and places will encourage students to connect themes across cultural, formal, and historical divides, utilizing interdisciplinary and theoretical methods in the process of their reading and writing.

In this course, students will learn to write for mainstream feature and short films, from ideation to synopses and beat sheets to the pages of an original screenplay. While this course will focus on short and feature film screenplays, the knowledge can also apply to other screenwriting forms such as documentaries and web series. Students will combine the creative with the technical, not only studying storytelling through film but also applying the structured authoring required by film producers and screenplay competitions for a feature or short film script. This course will be offered in 2024-25, and in alternating years thereafter. Students may not receive credit for both EN/WR 2410 and EN/WR 241X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommended background: No prior coursework is required.

This course presents an overview of how various perspectives can contribute to frameworks for environmental land use planning and management. Students are encouraged to think critically about problems land and natural resource use pose to society. Technical principles and analysis of sustainability planning are introduced and applied to challenges that communities currently face such as food, fiber and energy production, environmental conservation, hazard mitigation and resilience, water security, economic development, and waste management. Techniques to engage a diverse set of stakeholders in a collaborative planning process are examined along with the role of technology.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThis course will be offered in 2019-20, and in alternating years thereafter\u003C/p\u003E",

Through resilience we can live, and even thrive, in the face of natural disasters. Resilience involves adaptation to the wide range of regional and localized impacts that are expected with a warming planet: more intense storms, greater precipitation, coastal and valley flooding, longer and more severe droughts in some areas, wildfires, melting permafrost, warmer temperatures, and power outages. Resilient design is the intentional design of buildings, landscapes, communities, and regions in response to these vulnerabilities. In this course, we will work to better understand what is at risk in a changing climate with more extreme and frequent disasters, the role people/companies and policies play in these disasters, who is most at risk and why, and develop resilient designs focused on practical, innovative, on-the-ground, and just solutions. \u003Cspan\u003E  \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E  \u003C/span\u003EStudents may not receive credit for both ENV 271X and ENV 2710\u003Cspan\u003E   \u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E  \u003C/span\u003ERecommended background: None\u003C/p\u003E",

Systems Thinking provides tools that\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Eenable program managers, systems engineers, scientists, economists, and business managers to\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Eidentify, understand, and control systems in order to improve system performance. The Systems\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EThinking analysis accounts for feedback and resistance to change often exhibited by real world\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Esystems. In this course, students will study system identification and delineation, causal loops\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Eand feedback diagrams, stock-and-flow diagrams, system leverage points, delays and\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Eoscillations, mental models and unintended consequences, and behavior patterns; and use these\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Econcepts to improve the performance of engineering, business, and complex social systems. The\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Ecourse will explore great system failures, how they might have been avoided, and how we can\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Elearn from them. Finally, students will learn how Systems Thinking explains the occasional\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Eirrational behavior of individuals, departments, businesses, and governments. Examples covered\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Ein this course may include the failure of strictly technological “fixes” to social issues (as in the\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Egovernment’s installation of wells in Togo in the 1980s,) the 2008 financial meltdown, the\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Efailure of the Lockheed L-188 Electra Turboprop Airplane, the failure of the Tacoma Narrows\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003EBridge (“Galloping Gertie”) in 1940, the decline of many commercial fisheries around the world,\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Ethe failure and success of companies like Research In Motion and Apple, and the unintended\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003Econsequences of combating drug-related crime.\u003Cbr /\u003E\u003Cbr /\u003ERecommended background: None.\u003C/p\u003E",

Students are introduced to the fundamental theme of materials science-- structure-property-processing relationships—in metals, ceramics, and plastics. Aspects of material structure range from the atomic to microstructural and macroscopic scales. In turn, these structural features determine the properties of materials. In particular, this course investigates connections between structure and mechanical properties, and how working and thermal treatments may transform structure and thus alter material properties.

This course offers the foundations of critical AI literacy. It aims to help students develop a robust understanding of what this transformation means, and what kind of new sensibilities and skills are needed in response to an AI-led transformation. The course focuses on: 1) technological and cultural trends that shape the perception of generative AI, 2) ethical concerns emerging from the use of generative AI in professional and nonprofessional contexts, and 3) effective and responsible practices of using generative AI in writing and other forms of communication. In addition to reading assignments, students will have the opportunity to experiment with generative AI and assess its limits and possibilities. The assignments include critical annotations, fact-checking procedures, creative workflow processes, ethical analyses, and interaction design inquiries. Recommended Background: None",

        "Course_Description": "Problem-solving is a fundamental mathematical skill. In this course, students will be exposed to problems coming from a wide range of mathematical disciplines; and will work together in a collaborative environment to explore potential solutions. Discussion problems may be inspired by the research of faculty leading the discussion, by past mathematical competitions (such as the Putnam Competition), or elsewhere. This course meets once per week, with an emphasis on discussion and exploration of problems. There will be no exam and no assigned homework. Grading is by participation only. This course may be taken multiple times; content will vary depending on the speakers. Grading for this course will be on a Pass/NR basis.Recommended background: Curiosity about Mathematics",

Successfu luse of regression analysis requires an appreciationof both the theory and the practical problems thatoften arise when the technique is employed withreal-world data. Topics covered include the theoryand application of the general linear regressionmodel, model fitting, estimation and prediction,hypothesis testing, the analysis of variance andrelated distribution theory, model diagnostics andremedial measures, model building and validation,and generalizations such as logistic responsemodels and Poisson regression. Additional topicsmay be covered as time permits. Application oftheory to real-world problems will be emphasizedusing statistical computer packages.

They will also be exposed to associatedissues in manufacturing process analysis, engineering design, material science,and in dimensional and surface metrology. Using machining as an example, thescience of manufacturing processes is developed in a combination of class workand laboratory experience. The laboratory experience includes an experimentalcomponent that relates process variables in machining with performance andmachined part quality.

It emphasizes CNC (computer-controlled)machining. Students will learn how to go from a solid (CAD, computer-aideddesign) model to a machined part, using CAM software (computer-aidedmanufacturing) and CNC machining. They will also be exposed to associatedissues in manufacturing process analysis, engineering design, material science,and in dimensional and surface metrology. Using machining as an example, thescience of manufacturing processes is developed in a combination of class workand laboratory experience. The laboratory experience includes an experimentalcomponent that relates process variables in machining with performance andmachined part quality.

        "Course_Description": "\u003Cp\u003EThe course provides fundamentals for vibration analysis of linear discrete and continuous dynamic systems, A vibrating system is first modeled mathematically as an initial value problem (IVP) or a boundary-initial value problem (BIVP) by the Newton-D’Alembert method and/or the Lagrange energy approach and then solved for various types of system. Explicit solutions for dynamic response of a linear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) system, both damped and undamped, is derived for free-vibration caused by the initial conditions and forced vibration caused by different excitations. Modal analysis is presented to solve for vibration response of both multi-degreeof-freedom (MDOF) systems and continuous systems with distributed parameters. As the basis of modal analysis, the natural frequencies and vibration modes of a linear dynamic system are obtained in advance by solving an associated generalized eigenvalue problem and the orthogonal properties of the vibration modes with respect to the stiffness and mass matrices are strictly proved. Computational methods for vibration analysis are introduced. Applications include but are not limited to cushion design of falling packages, vehicles traveling on a rough surface, multi-story building subjected to seismic and wind loading, and vibration analysis of bridges subjected to traffic loading.

These challenges are compounded by multidisciplinary applications to be developed inexpensively in short time while satisfying stringent design objectives. As a consequence, effective quantitative engineering methodologies, such as optical techniques, are frequently used in the study and optimization of advanced components and systems. In this course, modern laser metrology techniques are discussed and their practical applications to solve problems, with emphasis on nondestructive testing (NDT), are illustrated with laboratory demonstrations. Topics covered include wave and Fourier optics, classic and holographic interferometry, speckle techniques, solid-state lasers, fiber optics, CCD cameras, computer vision, camera calibration methods, and image processing and data reduction algorithms as required in quantitative fringe analysis. Detail examples of nondestructive testing and coherent optical metrology in solid mechanics, vibrations, heat transfer, electromagnetics, and reverse engineering are given. Students are required to work on projects depending on their background and interests. Recommended background: mechanics, materials, physics, knowledge of a high-level computer programming language.

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science.

The focus of this course is on direct metal AM processes that are used in aerospace, automobile, medical, and energy industries. The objective of the course is to enable students to understand the working principles of various additive manufacturing processes, assess the suitability of metal AM processes for different designs and applications, apply process design concepts to metal AM processes via analytical and finite element modeling approaches, and have an introductory-level understanding of design for AM. Through the course project, students will have the opportunity to experience hands-on design, manufacturing, and characterization of additively manufactured materials, and will work in an interdisciplinary team of mechanical, materials, and manufacturing engineers. The economics of the manufacturing process will also be addressed, with an emphasis on determining the major cost drivers and discussing cost minimization strategies.

The focus of this course is on direct metal AM processes that are used in aerospace, automobile, medical, and energy industries. The objective of the course is to enable students to understand the working principles of various additive manufacturing processes, assess the suitability of metal AM processes for different designs and applications, apply process design concepts to metal AM processes via analytical and finite element modeling approaches, and have an introductory-level understanding of design for AM. Through the course project, students will have the opportunity to experience hands-on design, manufacturing, and characterization of additively manufactured materials, and will work in an interdisciplinary team of mechanical, materials, and manufacturing engineers. The economics of the manufacturing process will also be addressed, with an emphasis on determining the major cost drivers and discussing cost minimization strategies.

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science.

        "Course_Description": "\u003Cp\u003EThis course enables secondary mathematics teachers to see how commonly taught topics such as number systems and polynomials fit into the broader context of algebra. The course will begin with treatment of arithmetic, working through Euclid’s algorithm and its applications, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic and its applications, multiplicative functions, the Chinese remainder theorem and the arithmetic of Z/n. This information will be carried over to polynomials in one variable over the rational and real numbers, culminating in the construction of root fields for polynomials via quotients of polynomial rings. Arithmetic in the Gaussian integers and the integers in various other quadratic fields (especially the field of cube roots of unity) will be explored through applications such as the generation of Pythagorean triples and solutions to other Diophantine equations (like finding integersided triangles with a 60 degree angle). The course will then explore cyclotomy, and the arithmetic in rings of cyclotomic integers. This will culminate in Gauss’s construction of the regular 5-gon and 17-gon and the impossibility of constructing a 9-gon or trisecting a 60-degree angle. Finally, solutions of cubics and quartics by radicals will be studied. All topics will be based on the analysis of explicit calculations with (generalized) numbers. The proposed curriculum covers topics that are part of the folklore for high school mathematics (the impossibility of certain ruler and compass constructions), but that many teachers know only as facts. There are also many applications of the ideas that will allow the teachers to use results and ideas from abstract algebra to construct for their students problems that have manageable solutions\u003C/p\u003E",

The focus of this course is on direct metal AM processes that are used in aerospace, automobile, medical, and energy industries. The objective of the course is to enable students to understand the working principles of various additive manufacturing processes, assess the suitability of metal AM processes for different designs and applications, apply process design concepts to metal AM processes via analytical and finite element modeling approaches, and have an introductory-level understanding of design for AM. Through the course project, students will have the opportunity to experience hands-on design, manufacturing, and characterization of additively manufactured materials, and will work in an interdisciplinary team of mechanical, materials, and manufacturing engineers. The economics of the manufacturing process will also be addressed, with an emphasis on determining the major cost drivers and discussing cost minimization strategies.

Surface metrology can be important in a wide variety of situations including adhesion, friction, catalysis, heat transfer, mass transfer, scattering, biological growth, wear and wetting. These situations impact practically all the engineering disciplines and sciences. The course begins by considering basic principles and conventional analyses, and methods. Measurement and analysis methods are critically reviewed for utility. Students learn advanced methods for differentiating surface textures that are suspected of being different because of their performance or manufacture. Students will also learn methods for making correlations between surface textures and behavioral and manufacturing parameters. The results of applying these methods can be used to support the design and manufacture of surface textures, and to address issues in quality assurance. Examples of research from a broad range of applications are presented, including, food science, pavements, friction, adhesion, machining and grinding. Students do a major project of their choosing, which can involve either an in-depth literature review, or surface measurement and analysis. The facilities of WPI’s Surface Metrology Laboratory are available for making measurements for selected projects. Software for advanced analysis methods is also available for use in the course. No previous knowledge of surface metrology is required. Students should have some background in engineering, math or science.

As we analyze significant musical works, we will also learn about the broader cultural, historical, and social contexts in which they appeared, and the people involved in their creation – including women and people of color, who are often minimized in discussions of music history. Historical examples will be juxtaposed with contemporary musical works from an array of genres, allowing students to compare today’s musical cultures to past ones. Students will also analyze the role of music in their own lives. Recommended background: No prerequisites. A basic reading knowledge of music is helpful, but not required.\u003C/p\u003E",

We will investigate the practice and theory of sustainable supply chains and operations management in organizations throughout the world. This course is intended to provide students with understanding the intra- and interorganizational implications of environmental sustainability practices and policies. The role of organizational supply chain management functions, activities, tools and methods and their relationship to the natural environment will be introduced and discussed. The goals are for students to grasp the scope of general supply chain/operations management and environmental sustainability as they relate to the firm; to be able to relate to the manners in which management may respond and collaborate internally and with suppliers, customers, and various other stakeholders influencing and influenced by operational and supply chain activities from practical and theoretical case studies; able to evaluate various factors and understand tradeoffs in management decisions as they pertain to environmental supply chain management.\u003C/p\u003E",

After the initial excitement about the theory and its dramatic verification in 1919 by the Eddington expedition to observe the stellar aberration during a solar eclipse, the focus of attention moved to the newly developing field of quantum mechanics. However, there has been a resurgence of interest since the 1960’s that has steadily brought this area of research to the fore. The most recent observations of gravity waves, black holes, and the development of the global positioning system, – all have excited scientists and the general public about Einstein’s theory.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cspan\u003E  Recommended Background:\u003C/span\u003E \u003Cspan\u003EPH 2201 (Intermediate Mechanics II)\u003C/span\u003E\u003C/p\u003E",

Health psychologists study how psychology contributes to the promotion and maintenance of health, the prevention and treatment of illness, and the evaluation and improvement of the healthcare system. This course takes a deep dive into the scientific research on how various psychosocial factors are implicated in health, wellness, and illness. Topics covered in this course include: stress, health behavior change, health communications, psychoneuroimmunology, health disparities, patient-provider relationships, social support, coping, aging, and more. We will explore pressing questions such as: What does stress do to your health? What psychological and social factors lead people to behave in healthy or unhealthy ways? What drives racial, ethnic, or gender differences in health? Does it matter how your doctor talks to you? Can a sugar pill help back pain? En route to answering these questions, students will curate their knowledge in foundational Health Psychology theory and the core biopsychosocial constructs in the field. They will integrate these constructs to analyze and understand drivers of health, wellness, and illness in themselves and the world. No prior experience with psychology is needed to take this course. Students may not receive credit for both PSY 2408 and PSY 3408. Recommended background: Introduction to Psychological Science (PSY 1400) and/or Social Psychology (PSY 2402).\u003C/p\u003E",

The course is organized in four parts. In the first part, the students will learn about complex systems and the basic concepts of self-organization, such as positive and negative feedback, symmetry breaking, and emergence. The second part concerns several types of network models, such as information cascades, epidemics, and voting. The instructor will illustrate a diverse collection of self-organized systems in nature, finance, and technology that concretize these concepts. The third part is dedicated to swarm robotics, and will cover common swarm algorithms for task allocation, collective motion, and collective decisionmaking. The fourth and final part covers optimization algorithms inspired by swarm intelligence, namely ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization. The course will blend theory and practice, challenging the students to learn by implementing the algorithms discussed in class through a final project in swarm robotics.

Therefore, it is important to consider strong guarantees on the correctness and safety of their behavior. These guarantees ensure the robot will execute the desired behavior and will not execute undesired behavior. The course will define formal notions of system properties such as safety and liveness, explain how to model and analyze those properties in systems that make decisions and act on them, and understand the specific challenges related to making guarantees on embodied AI systems. This course will cover many topics related to formal guarantees of safety and correctness in robotic and AI systems, including temporal logic-based planning, safe control via invariants and control barrier functions, neural net verification, closedloop control with machine learning components, safe reinforcement learning, and other state-ofthe-art topics at the intersection of safety, guarantees, AI, and robotics.

At the same time that this course reflects upon a transnational framework for understanding the continuum between U.S. Latinos and Latin American/Caribbean communities, we closely examine more U.S. based arguments supporting and contesting the use of Latino as an ethnic racial term uniting all U.S. Latino communities. We examine the ways in which U.S. Latinos have manufactured identities within dominant as well as counter cultural registers.

This course serves as a cornerstone for the quantitative aspects of global health and focuses quantitatively on the distribution and determinants of health in populations and communities. The goal is to provide a scientific and engineering foundation that seeks to reduce risk factors and improve health in a population through a strong quantitative analysis of causation, problem-solving, analytic reasoning. The study of epidemiology evaluates the multifactorial etiology and pathophysiology of chronic diseases and applies criteria for identification, prevention and control of infectious agents.

This course is intended to answer the why, what and how of MBSE. The course provides background and motivation for transitioning to MBSE from a document centric approach to systems engineering. The course provides a foundation for MBSE by first introducing SysML as a descriptive language for modeling systems in terms of their requirements, structure, behavior, and parametric constraints. The course then introduces the Object-Oriented Systems Engineering Method (OOSEM) as a method for applying SysML to support the specification, architecture design, analysis, and verification of complex systems. A systems modeling tool is also introduced and used throughout the course.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003EApplying MBSE on class projects help the student to grasp the fundamentals.

We will explore great system failures, how they might have been avoided, and how we can learn from them in developing and participating in current systems.

This course offers the foundations of critical AI literacy. It aims to help students develop a robust understanding of what this transformation means, and what kind of new sensibilities and skills are needed in response to an AI-led transformation. The course focuses on: 1) technological and cultural trends that shape the perception of generative AI, 2) ethical concerns emerging from the use of generative AI in professional and nonprofessional contexts, and 3) effective and responsible practices of using generative AI in writing and other forms of communication. In addition to reading assignments, students will have the opportunity to experiment with generative AI and assess its limits and possibilities. The assignments include critical annotations, fact-checking procedures, creative workflow processes, ethical analyses, and interaction design inquiries. Recommended Background: None",

II) Feature films are at the heart of a motion picture industry that requires a partnership of multiple disciplines working in unison: acting, directing, filming, and producing.

In this course, students will learn to write for mainstream feature and short films, from ideation to synopses and beat sheets to the pages of an original screenplay. While this course will focus on short and feature film screenplays, the knowledge can also apply to other screenwriting forms such as documentaries and web series. Students will combine the creative with the technical, not only studying storytelling through film but also applying the structured authoring required by film producers and screenplay competitions for a feature or short film script. This course will be offered in 2024-25, and in alternating years thereafter. Students may not receive credit for both EN/WR 2410 and EN/WR 241X.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp\u003ERecommended background: No prior coursework is required.
